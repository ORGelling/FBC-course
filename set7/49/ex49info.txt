Exercise 49: 

Time a program that has the failbit set as it sends a debug message into an
outstream object.

Without the if clause:
49$ time ./tmp/bin/binary 100'000'000

real	0m3,389s
user	0m3,385s
sys	0m0,004s


With:
49$ time ./tmp/bin/binary 100'000'000

real	0m1,967s
user	0m1,963s
sys	0m0,004s

Clearly the if clause is guarding a bunch of extra evaluations from being
done. The case where the stream itself is evaluating the failbit takes almost
twice as long. It seems the ostream object itself is evaluating whether the 
failbit is set and suppressing output, but it takes much longer than the if 
statement does.

A fitting rule of thumb here would probably be to not let a stream do
computations that can easily be checked elsewhere. Or more simply: don't rely
on the stream object to evaluate and suppress output if you know there will
be things to suppress.
