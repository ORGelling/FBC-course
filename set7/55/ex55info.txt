Exercise 55: 

Write the Lock class and a program that locks a file and appends a line of
text to it.

We do exactly this, choosing not to refactor subroutines like copying the
string into a char *, as the exercise specifies that no more members are
needed than the ones mentioned. We had some trouble juggling the conversions
from char *s to strings and back and forth, and as such hope this works. There
might be room for improvements and optimisation by either leaning more on char
* and less on strings, but that is a matte rfor another time.

We note that checking for memory leaks with valgrind makes the program fail to
open the lock file! This might be due to the way valgrind runs the input
commands? Maybe it runs from a different directory, as we specifically see our
validate function output the debug message that there was an issue with the
lock file itself. We do not see any memory leaks luckily!

As for writing a library:
