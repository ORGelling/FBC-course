Exercise 53:

Format the output of a sincle concatenated cout statement to show a multitude
of options.

We do this exactly, noting that for the 3 digit output option we could not
find a manipulator that can set the maximum length of the full amount of
digits to display, instead we have used 'fixed' and a precision of 1, to keep
the 0. This should fulfill the requirement of the exercise.
