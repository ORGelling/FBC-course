Exercise 53:

Format the output of a single concatenated cout statement to show a multitude
of options.

We do this exactly. We have left out the push operators where possible. We
considered adding " | ios::showpoint" to the resetflags(ios::fixed) function's 
argument, as showpoint persists after being set. Since it would not show any 
change to value's output we have elected to keep it out, but do understand
that it means not all special formatting rules have been undone.
