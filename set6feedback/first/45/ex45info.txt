Exercise 45:

We re-amend the Strings class to use a block of raw memory (not double
pointers) that gets initialised by placement new when new data is needed. All
the data is copied to a new block once the capacity is reached.

This is similar in structure to the previous exercise, and also has overlap
with 41.
