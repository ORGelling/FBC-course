Exercise 10: Acquire familiarity with std::string objects

We make a basic function that defines string line and asks for an input with
getline(). We then use a single cout statement where we create a substring
of our input line. We use line.first_not_of() to find the first nonblank 
character, and set that as the starting position for our substring. We then
use this same value and the result of line.find_last_not_of(), which finds 
the position of the last nonblank character, to find the length of the 
substring inbetween the leading and trailing blanks.

This is enclosed in a backquote and a single quote, and finished with a new
line character.
