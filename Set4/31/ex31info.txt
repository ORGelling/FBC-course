Exercise 31:

Write a calculator program.

Since the calculator class from the previous exercise is quite comprehensive,
our main function needs very little fluff. It doesn't even need any headers
other than the calculator.h, parser.h, and line.h file, as everything 
necessary is already invluded inside the class's internals.

Our calculator is relatively barebones. The usage information pops up when the
program is started, and errors show when relevant. Other than that it shows
simply the recommended "? " prompt.

As discussed in the previous exercise, we only consider the epsilon value to
determine if something is "zero enough" for the division's rhs operand. This
does not seem to harm the calculator's functionality though.

Here follows an interaction with the calculator:

$ ./main
This is a simple calculator. 

     Input is given by:
[number] [operator] [number]
  
 where the operator may be
     
     +   -   *   /   %

Only one computation can be 
      given in a line. 
Enter a blank line to quit.

         Thank you 
  for using our calculator.

? 420 * 69
28980
? 356 / 18
19.7778
? 5 - 360.78
-355.78
? 27 % 12
3
? 1 / 0.000000000001
Cannot divide by 0
? 316 % -3
Invalid modulo operation
? 

After which we entered an empty line to quit the program.
