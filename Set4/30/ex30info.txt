Exercise 30:

Make a simple calculator.

This class needs no explicitly defined constructor since all its members are
either subclass objects with their own constructors which auto initialise 
those objects safely, or can be given a standard initialisation value inside
the header. Other than that all data will be provided during runtime, so the
basic constructor that the compiler builds for us will do all that needs to
be done.
