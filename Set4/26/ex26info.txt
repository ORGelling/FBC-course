Exercise 26:

Complete and implement the Person class from the annotations. Add insert() and
extract() functions.

We have done exactly this! We add a main function to show our completed
product, demonstrating the insert and extract functions like so:

$ ./a.out
Name    : Frank Brokken
Address : Groningen
Phone   : 0612345678
Mass    : 65
Jurjen Bokma,Groningen,0687654321,75
Name    : Jurjen Bokma
Address : Groningen
Phone   : 0687654321
Mass    : 75

where the first output is from the Person object defined in main() and the
second is prompted by the program through the extract function, and then also
inserted into cout to show the result. (We apologise if the weights are off,
we simply guessed!)
