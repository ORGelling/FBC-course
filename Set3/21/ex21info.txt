Exercise 21: Make a quicksort function

We have ended up making a quicksort function that uses Hoare's partition
scheme. This function partitions an array of strings into two parts and
compares all the strings of each array part with the leftmost member of that
array. Anything that should be alphabetically aligned left of it will be
swapped. It recursively calls itself over and over on the array parts left and
right of this pivot until only very small array sections are left and 
everything is sorted nicely. 

As in other exercises this week, we have elected to leave const size_t's as
is, and to not make them references, as doing so would not save memory or
computation time, and leaves the intent of the code a bit clearer.
