Exercise 18: Write a program with functions combine, structCall, boundCall,
and whatever else needed. 

Functionalities like showing value output and the usage message are divided 
out into extra functions. We implicitly cast our argc ints to size_t's by
having all of our functions recieve size_t argc's, like is recommended in the
hints and tips.

The program ////

We note that calling ./main 0 gives us a segfault. Thus we have added a lower
and upper limit to combine.cc
