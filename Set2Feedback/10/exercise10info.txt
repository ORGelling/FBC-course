Exercise 10: Acquire familiarity with std::string objects

We make a basic function that defines string line and asks for an input with
getline(). We then use a single cout statement where we create a substring
of our input line. We use line.first_not_of() to find the first nonblank 
character, and set that as the starting position for our substring. We then
use this same value and the result of line.find_last_not_of(), which finds 
the position of the last nonblank character, to find the length of the 
substring inbetween the leading and trailing blanks.

This is enclosed in a backquote and a single quote, and finished with a new
line character.
// HB: SF

Noteworthy is that, for us, this compiles and runs even if we don't include 
<string>.  This is likely due to it being included along with the iostream 
header. We have left this inclusion in for safety, as it will likely be 
guarded from double inclusion.
// HB: good thinking: the inclusion of string in iostream isn't guaranteed
// HB: (I think), so keeping it there for safety is probably smart.
// HB:
// HB: that being said: double inclusion is not prevented, but that's not 
// HB: that big of a deal since it is only declarations: if it wasn't, double
// HB: inclusions would give a compiler error due to the ODR
