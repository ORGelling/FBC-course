# Exercise 2.
Basic exercise
Purpose of this exercise: understand the meanings of several core concepts that are frequently encountered when constructing C++ programs.

Give short (1-2 sentences) answers to the following questions

    In C++, what's the difference between a declaration and a definition?
    What are header files used for?
    When a compiler creates a program, in what part of the construction process does it use header files and in what part libraries? (Answer the question by focusing on the fact that the compiler uses header files and libraries.)
    Is a library an object module? Explain, and do not just answer yes or no.
    Why is an object file obtained after compiling a source containing int main() not an executable program? 

Note: when answering this exercise, if you feel the need for using terminology like `independently relocatable code', (we're not suggesting you should!) then that's nice, but please in that case, also explain what you mean by that.
