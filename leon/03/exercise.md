# Exercise 3.
Basic exercise
Porpose of this exercise: get an early helicopter-view: learn some essential additions to C offered by C++

Describe six (major) aspects of C++ which are not available in C. Give for each of these aspects a short (1, at most 2 sentences) description what its purpose is.

When submitting five major aspects your rating will be `?', when submitting six major aspects your rating will be `1'.

Hint: don't report trivially small things (like sizeof(char) is != sizeof(int)), but first study the slides and relevant sections of the Annotations.
