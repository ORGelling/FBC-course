Exercise 54: 

Make a program that can read through a file and can interactively change and 
output its lines.

We do this exactly, choosing to use an array of pointers to member functions
inside process(), as we have learned how to use them and it seemed a nice fit!
We do use a switch inside ask, as that makes plenty of sense there. We tried
to keep is compact and readable, using a fallthrough for actions that could be
combined, but that doesn't really save much space anyways. We keep it as it is
part of the covered materials and a nice little detail (I learned abot it so
why not use it!).

When an incorrect command is given to the ask() function, it is interpreted as
a simple 'n'. We considered adding functionality that either resets the
d_location variable so that user error can be amended, but do not think it
necessary to implement it at this time. It could be done without much issue by
adding a
d_location -= d_target.length();
statement to the default case.

We also note that the exercise names an istream, where we used an ifstream.
Not exactly the same but they are both istreams of one sort or another! It
seemed proper to use the file version for this.

We add a short passage from a favourite book of mine and a version amended by
this program (target: He, replacement: Paul Muad'dib)
