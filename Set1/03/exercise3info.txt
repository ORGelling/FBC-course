Exercise 3: Describe six major differences between c and c++

1 - Strict type checking // Amended
    As opposed to C, the C++ compiler is very strict with type checking, and
    will not compile if a prototype is not known for each function. As an 
    example, implicit type conversion is not allowed in C++, whereas it is 
    often in C.

2 - Namespaces
    C++ allows for the use of namespaces, which C does not have. Namespaces 
    allow for defining symbols in a specific context, without running into 
    name conflicts.

3 - Scope resolution operator ::
    The scope operator is newly introduced for C++, and allows for 
    distinguishing between global and local variables with the same name. It 
    is used to call class-bound function members or specify which namespace
    is being drawn from. 

4 - Default function arguments  // Amended
    As opposed to C, in C++ a function can be defined with default arguments,
    if done so the compiler will provide the argument for the function even
    if no arguments are specified when it is called. Handing the function an
    argument when calling it will then override this default.

5 - Function overloading
    Contrarily to C, C++ allows functions to be overloaded, meaning that 
    multiple functions can have the same name as long as they take different
    arguments, either by type, by amount, or a combination of both. Even 
    const can be used for overloading.

6 - Classes, objects, inheritance
    C++ allows for classes, objects, inheritance, and other functionalities. 
    Many of these are connected to defining and using classes, or classes 
    inheriting functionalities from others. C simply has no classes to begin
    with, so cannot allow for any of the complexer functionalities that build
    on them.

We recognise that the last two answers are not part of the covered topics, 
but found them interesting enough to use. We can also add differences in
structs, RSL's, and general additions to C's grammar instead on the final 
hand-in. We hope though that this isn't an issue for a theory bound question 
like this one.
