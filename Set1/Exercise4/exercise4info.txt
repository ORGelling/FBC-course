Exercise 4 information

We choose a special combination for the parentheses to differentiate them from
the )" that shows up in the string literal, which would otherwise close our 
string. We can pick any unique combination of keys with the parenthesis, and it
will then only look for that combination of keys inbetween the ) and "

example:
R"veryuniquesetofcharacters(  raw string here  )veryuniquesetofcharacters"

We used R"special(  ...  )special"
