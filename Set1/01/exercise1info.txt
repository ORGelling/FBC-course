Exercise 1

We must write a hello world program, compile it into an object, or a pre-
compiled file, and then link that object into an executable.

The object (hello.o) file serves as a compiled version of this file without 
being turned into a full working executable program. This makes it easier
to work with large programs where multiple source files are used. Changes
made to a single source file then do not require a complete recompilation of 
the entire program, instead the specific source file can be recompiled, and
the rest of the (already) "pre-"compiled files can simply be linked by the
compiler. This saves a lot of time and computation power, and makes working on
large projects much more overseeable. It also ties in well with separate file
structures that often come with classes and such.

The executable file on the other hand is the complete set of functional 
instructions that the computer must follow to run the program. It 

The commands used for this exercise:
g++ -c hello.cc -Wall -Werror
to compile it, and 
g++ hello.o -o hello -s -Wall -Werror
to link it

The sizes of our files in bytes:
hello.cc:   256
hello.o:    1632
hello:      14376
iostream:   3074
