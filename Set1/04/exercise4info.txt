Exercise 4 information

We choose a special combination for the start and end parentheses, used to 
denote the start and end of a raw string literal, to differentiate them from
the parentheses that show up in the contents of the string literal, which would
otherwise be interpreted as the ending sequence of our string literal. We can 
pick any unique combination of 'd-char's with the parenthesis of at most 16
characters long, where a 'd-char' is a character from the basic source 
character set (excluding parentheses, backslash and spaces). This will then 
only look for that combination of keys inbetween the ) and ".

example:
R"veryuniquesetofcharacters(  raw string here  )veryuniquesetofcharacters"

We used R"special(  ...  )special"

The rule would thus become:
Use special parentheses when the content of the raw string literal contains 
parentheses. Select special parentheses that do not appear in the content of 
the raw string literal.
