Frank Brokken's C++ Course 2025

This is where I and my fellow contributers will work on and store our attempts
at answering the questions and exercises to Frank's course.

Each set will be handled in a specific branch, ranging from setX for part 1 to
p2sX for part 2, and when part 3 comes around we will keep that convention.

Feel free to browse, it will also serve as a showcase of my work to anyone 
curious. If you are a fellow student taking this course I highly recommend 
making the exercises yourself and not just copying these.

Cheers,

Olivier
