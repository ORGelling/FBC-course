Frank Brokken's C++ Course 2025

This is where I and my fellow contributers will work on and store our attempts
at answering the questions and exercises to Frank's course.

Each set will be handled in a specific branch, as branch set1 is currently 
reflecting our work, as one might guess, on the first homework set!

Feel free to browse, it will also serve as a showcase of our work to anyone 
curious. If you are a fellow student taking this course I highly recommend 
making the exercises yourself and not just copying these.

Cheers,

Olivier
