Exercise 63:

Finish the union from the previous exercise by wrapping it inside a wrapper  
class.

We do exactly this! We note that the exercise does not ask of us to make our
wrapper class test for the correctness of our accessors. This seems like it
would be relevant though. We are currently not implementing them but realise
that they should not be very complex. Something as simple as testing the
correct d_type (if (d_type != VALUE) for value() for instance), and returning
an empty object that is declared in a namespace above that function in its
source file. (We have the accessors implemented inline inside the header for
now).
