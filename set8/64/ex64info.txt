Exercise 64: 

We have not been able to complete this exercise as it is rather complex and
draws from a lot of material that is not actually covered yet, like Nested
Classes (chapter 17). We will keep working on it and hope to have a version to
hand in before next monday, but sadly we have to accept that we might not be
able to complete this one, as it is rather complex.

We have something working here! It is properly understanding how to handle
short and long arguments and the values that come with them! It does not seem
to recognise the long and short forms of options equivalently? -f works and
consumes a commandline argument, but --filenames does not. The value is also
not being passed properly.
