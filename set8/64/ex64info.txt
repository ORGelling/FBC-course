Exercise 64: 

This exercise was a whole lot of work! We have a mostly functional version of
Arg going, but it has a few (at times glaring) flaws:

We can now use long variants of a short option to set a value in both of their
arrays. Check. We cannot do the opposite of setting the value of a long option
using its short counterpart.

When we hand option() a string pointer that already points to an earlier
assigned string, it is not properly clearing this value. We are not sure why
this is. We have added an extra checks to our Arg::option()functions to clear,
value, but it seems something is going wrong enough for the ArgOption and
ArgLongOption size() functions to not be able to properly distinguish these
cases, as those functions *should* already be able to clear the pointed-at
string in the case no return value is present.

Something else that is worth criticism is the large size of our second arg
constructor. It makes sense for this member to be comprehensive, but it can
definitely do with some further compactifying! We will leave it as-is for now.

An example is the following output

64$ tmp/bin/binary --filenames files
f 1: files
filenames 1: files

64$ tmp/bin/binary -f files
f 1: files
filenames 0: 

We see that calling --filenames triggers both option() calls, while calling -f
leaves the long option's value blank. Before adding our somewhat crude value
check it would also even show:
filenames 0: files
which is of course not right.

We will also add a small comment to the graders: I (Olivier) took a look at
Frank's Tom Poes -eh I mean- Bobcat class, and have made a decent bit of use
of copilot for this exercise, especially to get started and see some structure
arising from the chaos. Every line of code was, of course, written by me, and
the main fix I have been working on these last few days was not inspired by
peeking at bobcat's Arg__, although I will say it helped to see my solution 
mostly verified! As such I would recommend limiting this exercise's score for
us to half a point at most, even after resubmission. 0 points is fine as I
would just be happy with feedback and a working class!
