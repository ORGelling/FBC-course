Exercise 64: 

We have not been able to complete this exercise as it is rather complex and
draws from a lot of material that is not actually covered yet, like Nested
Classes (chapter 17). We will keep working on it and hope to have a version to
hand in before next monday, but sadly we have to accept that we might not be
able to complete this one, as it is rather complex.
