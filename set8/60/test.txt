We construct an object:
Demo demo1;
calling basic constructor.

We then call the copy constructor:
Demo demo2(demo1);
calling copy constructor.

Now we will try to call the move constructor:
Demo demo3(Demo::factory());
calling factory.
calling basic constructor.

It was elided away! To do it correctly we call:
Demo demo4(move(demo3));
calling move constructor.

Now we will show copy assignment in action:
demo4 = demo3;
executing copy assignment.

and move assignment:
demo2 = Demo::factory();
calling factory.
calling basic constructor.
executing move assignment.
