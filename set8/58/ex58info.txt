Exercise 58: 

Write a class Numbers with move and copy constructors and assignment
operators, and other specific member functions.

We do exactly this, writing our write() function such that it iterates over
d_size, and as such will not automatically show uninitialised memory. We run
the program through valgrind instead and see:

==71579== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

==71579== Use of uninitialised value of size 8

==71579== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
 
==71579== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

This message pops up particularly whenever an object is being initialised
with the second constructor!
