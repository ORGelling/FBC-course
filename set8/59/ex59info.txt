Exercise 59: 

Amend the given Strings class to either copy or move when enlarging, and time
how long a number of iterations of each takes.

We do exactly this, adding probably a few more functions and constructors than
strictly necessary for this process. We time our outputs and get:

$ time tmp/bin/binary 10000

real	0m0,485s
user	0m0,482s
sys	    0m0,004s

$ time tmp/bin/binary 10000 false

real	0m0,088s
user	0m0,085s
sys	    0m0,003s

We note that rather than finnicking around with checking the exact text of the
last commandline argument, we just set the copy bool to false when there *is*
another argument after the iteration number. Not very pretty but it works.
