Exercise 18: Write a program with functions combine, structCall, boundCall,
and whatever else needed. 

Functionalities like showing value output and the usage message are divided 
out into extra functions. We implicitly cast our argc ints to size_t's by
having all of our functions recieve size_t argc's, like is recommended in the
hints and tips.

We run an initial check for the right amount of input arguments, and have
combine check again for proper validation of the selected one, guarding for
selecting argument 0 or any argument beyond existing ones.

The program is not divided up into subdirectories yet. Would be nice, but more
fitting to do once we have classes to work with.
