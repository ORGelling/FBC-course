Exercise 20: Make a wc program that counts lines, words, and characters 
depending on what flag is set.

We have done exactly so. Splitting the program up into 3 functions that count
characters, words, or lines, all from the input stream, like a redirected
file. We also add a usage function that prints usage into.

We note that our program doesn't work exactly like wc does, as it will count
final lines that are not terminated with a newline character. Our program 
will also count empty trailing lines. We don't mind the distinction from wc
itself, as counting logical lines seems like the right thing to do when
looking for all the lines in a file. We hope this still fulfills the purpose
of the exercise.

JB: With regard to that final newline, realize that if(cin()), i.e.
JB: if(cin.good()) still returns true even if cin.eof() is true but eof.fail()
JB: and eof.bad() are not, which is exaclty the case when getline() has
JB: extracted characters but not found a delimiter (i.c. usually a newline).
