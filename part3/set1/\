Exercise 4: Design a generic function template

We use perfect forwarding to hand the parameters on to the function without
needing to worry about their amount or their type of reference.

To make sure the forwarder template can select the right overloaded function
we use a static_cast to specify this inside the template call in main. We can
also declare a function pointer and assign it the specific overloaded function
we need, like so:

void (*funcPtr)(int, int) = fun;
forwarder(funcPtr, 1, 3);
