Exercise 1: Show that templates do not result in "code bloat"

We use our internal header to declare the template and the two functions that
use it. These two use a reinterpret cast to insert the address of the called
function into cout. The output of main, which calls both, is as follows:

$ tmp/bin/binary 
Address of function 1's constructed template: 0x561afa06f200
Address of function 2's constructed template: 0x561afa06f200

The address is the same!
