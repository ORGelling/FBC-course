Exercise 6: Design and use a function template

We keep our insertion operator as a free function by declaring it a friend
inside the interface. This allows it access to the class's private section. It
would be prettier to add a private backdoor this way, as friends shouldn't
directly interact with private data, but we hope this still serves to
demonstrate the exercise's target topics.
