Exercise 39: Solve the reversing train cars riddle

We implement Factory's put, revert, and reverse functions, seemingly
simplifying some of the steps implied by the exercise. 

We do not need the min function inlined in the .ih, instead we check available
cars from the source stack and space on the side track directly in our while
loop. 

We also do not use a while and a breaking if inside our revert function, as we
can simply compute the amount of cycles we must go through before all the cars
have been successfully reversed.

We do admit that our solution is slightly less elegant in its final step, as
the last put() operation in our revert function sets all the used cars back
into d_rhs for the next loop to start clean. This means that, at the end of
the last iteration the cars are moved back and forth a bit unnecessarily. We
take this as it is since it seems to be a functional and efficient solution
all the same. Timing the program with 100000 cars gives us a time of:

real	0m1,597s
user	0m1,582s
sys	    0m0,015s

one million will take a whole damn while though, but a train with one million
cars is likely not even going to be seen in the US! (Let alone some poor
engine be able to pull that!)
