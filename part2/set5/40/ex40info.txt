Exercise 40: Define a class with its data being elsewhere

We use a helper function only visible to the internal header and member
functions, that handles an unordered_map that contains pairs of size_t's
(object index) and vector<string>s (te actual liens of text). We considered
using a vector of tuples, or a vector of structs, but with an unordered_map we
can use the address of the current object (this) as the key, to easily find
our object with get() and to make delecting the right object in the destructor
easier. This does mean we need to search through the whole map when calling
get(size_t idx), but all in all we consider this the most effective approach.

We add the output of our test run that was redirected into return.txt, to show
how our program works. We added some extra lines and accessed the data in the
objects beyond the first one through their direct get() functions without the
index, as it seems strange the main function given by the exercise does not
attempt this. We hope our answer to this exercise is not overengineered, and
instead a nice, albeit slightly elaborate, approach to this quandry.
