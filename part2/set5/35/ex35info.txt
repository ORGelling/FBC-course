Exercise 35: Simplify the Strings class using containers

We do not need to implement the constructor as a default one is just fine with
our vector setup, same for the destructor. 

We have a very simple implementation for +=, using push_back.

In main we use getline rather than direct extraction since the original
Strings class also stored all the lines as individual strings, rather than
separating them by spaces. We have left the other option commented out.
