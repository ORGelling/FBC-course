Exercise 36: Use smart pointers in the Strings class

I have decided to remove safeAt altogether and make it clear that the index
being sought through op[] was oob by giving the user a very handy (and
deserved) segfault. This is probably a safer way of implementing this aspect
of the class since an empty line being handed back could slip through and 
cause the issue to be left unnoticed and unaddressed. It seems fine to reach
into Strings' data members directly through Proxy if we can call at() on the
vector d_data, and as such we will mainly be interacting with the actual
strings (from inside Proxy's members) using *p_owner->d_data[p_idx]. This
keeps efficiency high an behaviour exactly as expected as long as we make sure
bounds are being checked in the non-const Strings::at() function. Passing the
bounds check down to Proxy::operator string const &() interferes with the
intended function
