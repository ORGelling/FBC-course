Exercise 2: Extend the Numbers class to make use of arithmetic operators.

We do this, adding likely some TC aspects by following the flowchart from the
lacture. Yet this does mean our operations (other than multiplication) are now
move-aware, and implementing both the move aware and standard (no reference 
qualifiers) has been useful practice. We hope demonstrating both options is
appreciated, but will understand a TC mark-down.
