Exercise 16: Learn to make existing code exception safe

Q1- Is the default Strings constructor as shown exception safe?
A - No. rawPointers can throw an exception like, for instance, bad_alloc. We
    could have the default constructor initialise the members to 0 instead and
    then allocate the memory in a constructor that has already delegated the
    base initialisation to the default one, where we catch the possible
    exceptions.

What happens when:
1 - The default constructor fails and throws an exception?
A - 
    
2 - The calling constructor fails and throws an exception?
