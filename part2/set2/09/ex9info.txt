Exercise 9: Understand the behaviour of incompletely constructed objects

Q1: Explain why demo's destructor is not called:
The destructor is not called since the constructor never finishes running. The
closing '}' of this constructor is never reached and as such this object is
not considered (fully) constructed.

Q2: Modify the constructor so that demo's destructor *is* called. Explain why
it is actually called now.
We remove the "function try" block and instead use a nested try/catch *inside*
the constructor's body such that the throw is now handled inside the
constructor. Control will now properly reach the end of this constructor and
as such this object's construction is finalised. As such the destructor is now
called when it goes out of scope.

Q3: When is the destructor called?
As mentioned above, when the object goes out of scope, which is at the end of
main()'s (function) try block. The catch block is never even used now, and can 
even be omitted together with its try block. The exception is handled inside 
the constructor and, as is the only good practice in such matters, does
not leave it!
