Exercise 14: TempFile class and cleaning up (you guessed it!) temporary files

We make TempFile, using chrono to seed random numbers inside a lambda
function. We add move construction and assignment to the class, deleting copy
operations as we do not want to and cannot properly copy streams between 
opjects.

We had our operations output demonstration messages to help testing what
happens for clarity, but can of course look in the /tmp/ directory, where
temp_directory_path() points to on my device, to see if they are created, and
then again destroyed. We can see that 

- files are neatly removed when the destructor is called.
- unrelated throws do not cause issues when main is provided with a catch
  block (that triggers). The file is removed all the same as the destructor 
  properly runs.
- *Not* catching the exception causes a dangling temp file. The destructor
  does not properly run in this case. I am left with the file "TMPg1%qB.tmp"
  in my /tmp/ directory.

We show these operations in the basic.cc file.

The class is also extended to contain a conversion operator that "steals" the
stream and file name, and clears out the data members to prevent the
destructor from meddling with this process. It then removes/unlinks the file
and hands the stream object off. We show it at work in our main.cc where some
text is first input into the file before it is converted. We then insert more
text into the unlinked stream object and finally insert its entire buffer into
cout, which works!
