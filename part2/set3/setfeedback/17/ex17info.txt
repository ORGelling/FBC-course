Exercise 17: Understand the different forms of inheritance

Q1- What members can be accessed by users of a Derived class that publicly
    inherits from Base?
A - Users of Derived will have direct access to all the public members of 
    Base. Only those are exposed for direct use by the inheritance process, as
    Base's Protected members are encapsulated by the class as private
    members, and its private members are not directly accessible by both the 
    Deriving class or its users.

Q2- What members can be accessed by its designer?
A - The designer of the class can make use of public and protected members of
    Base class. Any others are not directly accessible by the deriving class.
    
Q3- What changes if Derived uses protected inheritance?
A - for the design and use of Derived itself, nothing, however any class
    inheriting *from* derived, so a class DDerived, will only be able to
    reach the members of Base from inside the class DDerived itself, or in the
    wording of this exercise: Only the designer of DDerived can use Base's
    public members. They are closed off from DDerived's users.
    
Q4- What changes if Derived uses private inheritance?
A - Now even the public and protected members of Base are no longer available
    to classes inheriting from Derived. Only the interface Derived itself
    exposes to deriving classes (public and protected members) is available
    for use by the designer of DDerived.
