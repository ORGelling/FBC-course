Exercise 23: Compare the coupling of inheritance versus composition

Q1- What is the problem with inheriting from an unfinished WIP class into
    OpusMagnum?
A - When one inherits from an unfinished class that might change the
    implementation of our class OpusMagnum might be completely broken once WIP
    is finally finished. Maybe unaccounted for behaviour is added, maybe its
    members have different names, maybe its API has extra members, we simply
    do not know.
    
Q2- What if instead of inheriting from WIP we compose our class with a WIP
    data member?
A - This is a lot safer already but still requires care and may break our
    implementation if WIP changes before it is finished, similarly to above.
    At the very least our library and any programs that use it will have to be
    recompiled as it has to include WIP's interface entirely.

Q3- Show the problem can be avoided using a slightly different kind of
    composition.
A - We can instead use pimpl: Pointer to the IMPLementation. Instead of using
    a data member "WIP d_wip" we use a data member "WIP *d_wimpl". This keeps
    the implementations separate and does not require a complete recompilation
    of anything that uses WIP, as the libraries are now separate, and WIP is
    not included in OpusMagnum's interface. Assuming the API of WIP is
    functional, members are not renamed, nor their actions entirely changed,
    any changes or additions that have been made will not interfere with the
    OpusMagnum class nor programs that use it. The final version of the WIP
    library itself will simply have to be reinstalled and linked.
