Exercise 22: Learn about base class references.

We can call Derived::hello() from Base &obj using a static_cast<Derived>() or
static_cast<Derived &>(). static_cast<>() does not verify whether the
conversion is safe or whether anything will go wrong when using Derived's
functions on the casted object, but it does construct a proper Derived &
without changing the object that is being referenced. Hence it does not slice.
This is a safe form of downcasting as long as we actually are looking at a 
Derived object. Once we are allowed to use polymorphism though, this should
usually be done using a dynamic_cast<>() instead (and does require a virtual
member to be present in Base), as this checks at runtime if the cast is valid.

Another way to do this (badly) is by implementing an assignment operator that
allows us to bind a Base object to a Derived object and thus calling hello()
on that will call Derived::hello(). This option is very dangerous, and will
certainly lead to slicing if the assignment operator is not implemented
safely. (We did not implement a safe version of this!)
