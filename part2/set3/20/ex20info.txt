Exercise 20: 

In order to use all the functionality from std::string we simply publicly
inherit it, add the relevant "using" directives, and then declare all the
constructors and operators we need as default inside our interface.

We add one extra constructor to repeat-initialise our string, using a small
private helper function. It is not particularly efficient as it simply 
appends str count times, but it is exactly as clear and functional as we need
it to be.
