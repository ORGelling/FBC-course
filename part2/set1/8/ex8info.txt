Exercise 8: Extend the Strings class to use reference counting and proxies

Subquestion: Why can the shared-count member not be static?
Making it static would make it a shared data member for the entire class,
rather than for one specific object that is sharing its data. We need to keep
track of how many objects are sharing data with each other, and have to
consider multiple different base objects being shared from. This is not
compatible with a static (class wide) data member.

We have added a converstion operator to the Proxy class that can promote a
Proxy object to a const string, as such the insertion operator isn't actually
strictly necessary, but we have added it as it is part of the exercise. This
does imply that, in turn, our conversion operator is excessive and not part
of the exercise. We have kept it since it was a nice bit of practice and is
likely not a detriment to the class.
