Exercise 57: Design and implement a Semaphore class

We can basically just follow what the annotations show in chapter 20.4, and do
exactly that. We are instructed to make sure the size() member does *not* lock
the mutex, so instead we have chosen to make the d_size datamember atomic to
prevent data races and issues that can follow.
