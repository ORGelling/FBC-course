Exercise 64: End threads and child processes 

We inherit our Fork class from P2S4's exercise 31, and flesh out the parent
and child functions to fit the exercise's requirements. We have added wait_for
and set to 57, adding comments in the interface to signify they belong to this
exercise. We note however, that we did not see a use for set in this exercise.
We could use wait_for just fine, but (re)setting the semaphore's counter does
not factor in to our program at all.
