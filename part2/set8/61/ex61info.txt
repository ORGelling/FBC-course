Exercise 61: Implement a program using semaphores

We stick to the example from the lecture slides quite closely, and thus use 4
semaphores and 2 mutici. We note that we could leave out at least one
semaphore to uncap the workToDo amout, but this seems like a nice way to
practice using these tools!
