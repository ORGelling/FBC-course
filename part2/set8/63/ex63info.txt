Exercise 63: Implement the multithreaded compile program

We do this, hopefully up to taste! It's a big exercise, and keeping track of
all the includes is a hassle, so we may have left some extraneous includes in
headers that should have been moved to internal headers. Let us know if that
is an issue, but we hope that this exercise is close to being complete as is!
