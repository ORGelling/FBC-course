Exercise 41: Learn to use generic algorithms

And so it is. We make a program and the two classes, FillUnique and Random, to
exercise specifics. It feels a bit off to make a fill() function and not just
implement a function call operator for our FillUnique class instead, such that
we can simply call:

FillUnique filler{ (args) };
filler(rngVec);

The exercise specifics work just fine as well though.
