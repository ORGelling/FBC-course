Exercise 45: Broaden your view on reducing capacity

Q1- Why doesn't d_vect.clear() followed by pushing strings into it result in
    extra capacity when process() is repeatedly called?
    
The handmadeMove() function is not mentioned in the exercise directions. It is
shown in the given Shrink interface, and is also present in the provided main
function, but not in the output shown shortly beneath that. We will simply
omit creating and using it as we do not know what this function should look
like.
