Exercise 48: Use generic algorithms to process an unordered map

Even though the exercise tells us there is no generic algorithm that can 
modify the wip u_map for us we found that erase_if 

Other
than that we use G.A.'s wherever we can, and dip back into our pointer
knowledge to make a little array of function pointers to more tidily select
and execute our Date or Count filtering.
