Exercise 46: Learn to use generic algorithms to sort and keep a subset of
sorted information

We note that there are some entries that have "ID [number]" attached to the
subject names. This might be an error, or it might be some form of secondary
representation. Whichever it is, we keep the data as is and accept the
potential duplicates from this. We found at least one set that is affected by
this:

Other than that we approach the sorting and cutting as follows:

First we group everything by name primarily, and then by date (latest on top)
secondarily. We then use unique to filter out duplicate name entries. The
predicate here also prints the entry that is being removed. We know this is
MLR but we found it hard to limit our program to only three statements
otherwise.

We note that rather than using lambda functions with multiline bodies we
instead simply use functions that get called as function objects. This way the
code looks nice and clean, but the functionality is exactly the same.

We probably have an MLR in here, and maybe a TC. I am not entirely sure how to
keep this within 3 statements (not counting file processing and output). There
is the option of using an unordered set to check for duplicates, which means
we only have to sort once (as the data starts with dates in ascending order,
which I assume we can use consistently). That however would also require some
extra shenanigans, and leans more on containers than generic algorithms.
Feedback on this matter is very welcome.
