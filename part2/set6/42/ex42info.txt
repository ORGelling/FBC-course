Exercise 42: Learn to use promotion with generic algorithms and predefined
function objects when manipulating basic data types

We do exactly this, following the template of the annotations. We can run the
program like so:

$ tmp/bin/binary q r s u v w
q r s tmp/bin/binary u v w 
w v u tmp/bin/binary s r q

and see that it neatly orders everything correctly!
