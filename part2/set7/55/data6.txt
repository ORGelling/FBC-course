[Make manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/)

The Makefile causes `make` to want to build programs, or if there
  [internal headers explained](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11063355/is-anyone-familiar-with-the-implementation-internal-header-ih)
Because the Makefile detects which files include which others, updating a
LDFLAGS etc.) as well as FLEXCXX (defaults to: $(FLEXCXX)) and BISONCXX
    CXX_SOURCE_EXTENSION (defaults to: $(CXX_SOURCE_EXTENSION))
    VERBOSE=yes causes commands in recipes to be echoed.
Note that without analyzing dependencies, Make will not know which
    make mc/myclass.ih
file extension with non-program sources.
