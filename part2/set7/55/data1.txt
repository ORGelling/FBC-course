This Makefile is suitable for building small C++ projects.


* Bisonc++ will be called on any parser specification files (grammars).
* Program object files (detected by grepping the source for a `main`

included. Extensions can be set there too, though it should seldom be
    BISONCXX_PARSERSPEC_EXTENSION (defaults to: $(BISONCXX_PARSERSPEC_EXTENSION))
    DEP=no      causes dependency analysis to be skipped.
