Exercise 53: 

First form, without locks or mutexes wasn't even very mangled. Running it 4
times we get 2 instances of perfectly ordered data, and two of mangled ones,
the worst of which is the following:

$ tmp/bin/binary 
Line Line 00 from thread 0 from thread 2
Line 1 from thread 0
Line 2 from thread 0
Line 
Line 1 from thread 2
Line 2 from thread 2
0 from thread 1
Line 1 from thread 1
Line 2 from thread 1

We then add a mutex data member d_oMutex (for ostream-mutex), that allows our
threads to see when another is using cout, and get neatly unmangled output
like so:

$ tmp/bin/binary 
thread 2
Line 0 from thread 2
Line 1 from thread 2
Line 2 from thread 2
Line 3 from thread 2
thread 4
Line 0 from thread 4
Line 1 from thread 4
Line 2 from thread 4
Line 3 from thread 4
thread 0
Line 0 from thread 0
Line 1 from thread 0
Line 2 from thread 0
Line 3 from thread 0
thread 1
Line 0 from thread 1
Line 1 from thread 1
Line 2 from thread 1
Line 3 from thread 1
thread 3
Line 0 from thread 3
Line 1 from thread 3
Line 2 from thread 3
Line 3 from thread 3

Where we shake things up a tad by using 5 threads rather than 1.
