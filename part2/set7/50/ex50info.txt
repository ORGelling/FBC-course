Exercise 50: Perform time conversions

We can use duration_cast<[destination type]>([target]) to convert both, but
note that the first conversion (from hours to minutes) can be done implicitly,
while the second can not, since it breaks down the unit into a larger one and
thus might end up with fractions.

We choose to output the duration objects in full, but can also simply output
their value using .count()
