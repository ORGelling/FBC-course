Exercise 54: Make the class Storage which has a thread that acts on a queue

For this exercise we do not need to guard our queue's front and pop yet it 
seems, as we have only a single thread acting on it. The other thread only 
keeps track of the progress of the program. We may still want to lock our
queue when it is being accessed to keep issues from popping up, so we will add
a mutex all the same.
