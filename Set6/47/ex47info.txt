Exercise 47: 

Make a complex calculator that can store symbols in the symbol table from the
previous exercise.

We are trying exactly this, but it is a very complicated exercise with a lot
of moving parts, and the connection to the previous one's actual exercise
scope is tentative. We have a working calculator that can parse entire lines
of logic, but have a few issues:

Using assigned variables in calculations like x - 4, in this case we simply
output the value of x. 

Properly storing ident tokens, we see this in the fact that an expr() cannot
return an ident for us and as such show() does not treat variables as idents,
but as chars. We *do* store and show their values correctly though.

Both of these issues stem from the way variables are handled, and the way we
run things inside evaluate and the fact we do not have a properly implemented
assign() function yet.

We can do pretty much any and all calculations now, including parenthesized
expressions, but we are not yet properly using the symbol table.
