Exercise 57: 

Add copy and move constructors and overloaded assignment operators to the
Strings class from set 6's exercise 44.

We do exactly this, testing them in main.cc by forcing the move constructor
and assignment using the std::move() function to create rvalue references to
work with, that the class picks up on automatically.
