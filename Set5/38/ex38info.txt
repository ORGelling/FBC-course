Exercise 38:

Fix the code of the phonebook class

This program seems to have a static initialisation issue, where the
constructors are called before main() is even ran. 

A way to fix this would be to wrap our static object inside a function such
that it is initialised only when it is called/acted upon (and thus needed). 
This is known as the "Construct on First Use" idiom
