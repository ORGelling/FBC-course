Exercise 34:

Implement the CopyCat class by adding functions ntbsCopy, nElements, and
duplicate, and implementing the constructors.

We do exactly this, noting that we can separate finding the size of the array
out from calling duplicate, and passing d_size to duplicate as argument. Once
these functions have been finished they can be used inside the initialiser
list.

CopyCat() can be inline since it can simply call the 3rd constructor with a
default argument (which we declare the extern char above it for).
