Exercise 40:

Theory questions about pimpl:

Q1: Why does the program break when linking with the new library?
A1: Adding a new data member will change the size of the class objects. This
will change the internal memory layout. Even changing the order of data 
members will cause issues, like the memory offset not being correct anymore. 
If we add a new data member right at the top that is the member that will be
read by a program that expects the previous version of the library.

Q2: Why does it not after implementing the pimpl setup?
A2: With pimpl the implementation and class interface are decoupled, and as
such the ABI will not contain chainges made in the class's internals. Thus no
issues arise with memory layout!

Q3: How can you add additional members without using pimpl?
A3: In order to avoid ABI beakages while still adding extra members to a class
one can add them at the very end of the class. This will keep the order of the
data (and thus the memory layout) in the objects the same, but can still
cause issues due to the change in object size. This means adding a new
private section to the end of the class and putting the new member in there.
